### Minor Changes

- [#60](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/60) [`61230aa`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/61230aaca8bc8dcbbeb48d662a4f53f8d2c2a46c) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Plugins can now extend the player without editing core.

  Adding a control-bar button previously meant editing `@scarlett-player/ui`, and owning state meant editing `@scarlett-player/core` - `ControlSlot` was a closed union consumed by a `switch`, and `StateManager` threw for any key not in `DEFAULT_STATE`. Captions only looked like a self-contained package because core had already reserved its state keys, its event, and its control slot in advance. That does not scale, and it left third-party plugins with no route in at all.

  **Controls.** `registerControl(id, factory)` in `@scarlett-player/ui` registers a control under any id, and `ControlSlot` becomes `BuiltinControlSlot | (string & {})` so custom ids type-check while editors still autocomplete the built-ins. Registering never places a button on its own - a host opts in by listing the id in `uiPlugin({ controls: [...] })`. Because plugin init order is not guaranteed, a control registered after the control bar was built triggers a rebuild rather than being silently dropped, and a factory that throws is contained instead of taking the whole bar down.

  **State.** `api.defineState(key, initialValue)` registers plugin-owned state at runtime. It is idempotent, so a plugin re-running setup after a source change cannot reset state that is already live, and `reset()`/`resetKey()` now restore plugin keys to their defined initial value instead of writing `undefined`. State keys are split into `CoreStateStore` (what core owns, and what its defaults must cover exhaustively) and the open `StateStore`, so a plugin augmenting the latter can no longer break core's own compilation with a confusing missing-properties error.

  **Events** needed no change: `PlayerEventMap` is an interface and the event bus never validated names, so declaration merging already worked. This is now pinned by tests, and `@scarlett-player/core` type-checks the files carrying those guarantees - previously vitest transpiled them without type-checking, so a type-level contract could rot unnoticed.

  See `.claude/docs/plugin-authoring.md` for the conventions, including namespacing events and state keys with the plugin id.

### Minor Changes

- [#55](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/55) [`2828556`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/2828556b09bd2cc2e9c62d7f8e74ce325984c34c) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Playback fault absorption for the watch-page cutover. The HLS plugin now has a unified pipeline teardown with a load-session guard, so a superseded load, watchdog, retry timer, or reconnect attempt can never fire into the current session or leave a load promise hanging. MSE append and quota failures are classified as their own recoverable error codes (MEDIA_APPEND_ERROR, MEDIA_BUFFER_FULL) and still ride the media-recovery and auto-reconnect path. Live playlist refreshes are validated before parsing: an error page, master-only response, or empty document becomes a normal bounded network retry (PLAYLIST_INVALID when exhausted) instead of being indexed blindly, and playback continues on the previous playlist during retries. The light build now shares the full build's machinery (auto-reconnect, load watchdog, structured error codes, playlist validation) through one factory instead of drifting behind it. Core gains ErrorHandler.record() for advisory errors and records media element errors in history without flipping the player's error state.

### Minor Changes

- [#46](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/46) [`29c560d`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/29c560d3a199acb598f99ff1226b7c602775839f) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Make failure handling viewer-friendly: no silent hangs, self-healing reconnects, accurate error messages, and a Try Again that actually recovers.

  **No more permanent spinners.** Manifest-phase network errors (404/403, expired token, origin down) previously died silently after one recovery attempt because `startLoad()` cannot retry a manifest that never parsed, leaving `player.init()` pending forever. Manifest errors now retry with `loadSource()`, and a load watchdog (`loadTimeoutMs`, default 30s) guarantees every load attempt terminates with a real error.

  **Self-healing playback.** After a fatal network/media error mid-playback, the HLS provider now auto-reconnects with capped exponential backoff (configurable via `autoReconnect`, `reconnectBaseDelayMs`, `reconnectMaxDelayMs`, `reconnectWindowMs`), reconnects immediately when the browser comes back online, restores the viewer's VOD position from the moment of failure, and rejoins live streams at the live edge. The overlay shows "Connection lost. Reconnecting..." while working and hides itself on recovery. Retry budgets also reset once media flows again, so transient blips spread across a long live event no longer permanently consume them.

  **Accurate error messages.** Fatal HLS errors now carry structured codes (`MEDIA_NETWORK_ERROR`, `MEDIA_DECODE_ERROR`, `PLAYBACK_FAILED`) and the overlay maps codes before falling back to prose matching, so a network outage shows the connection message instead of "Something went wrong." The `error` state key is now populated from every error event (and cleared on successful load); it was previously declared but never written. New events: `error:reconnecting` and `error:recovered`.

  **Try Again fixed.** The overlay's retry now emits `error:retry`, which the core handles by reloading through the provider path and restoring position (live streams rejoin the live edge). It previously wrote the raw manifest URL onto the MSE-backed video element and reset playback to 0.

  Native HLS (Safari) fatal video errors are now surfaced as structured player errors instead of failing silently, and the native provider gained the same load watchdog.

### Minor Changes

- [#35](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/35) [`96bbb45`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/96bbb45881c45f2a183d1a56337bab1e47648ba7) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Automatic playlist loading, Chromecast playlist support, AirPlay improvements, watermark and captions plugins

  **Core:**
  - Added `media:load-request` event for plugins to request media loading without direct `player.load()` access
  - Promoted playlist events (`playlist:change`, `playlist:add`, `playlist:remove`, `playlist:clear`, `playlist:shuffle`, `playlist:repeat`, `playlist:reorder`, `playlist:ended`) to core `PlayerEventMap`
  - Added minimal `PlaylistTrack` interface to core types
  - Core player listens for `media:load-request` and routes load to local player (skips when Chromecast is active)

  **Playlist:**
  - New `autoLoad` config option (default: `true`) - automatically emits `media:load-request` on track change, eliminating the need for manual `player.load()` wiring
  - New `advanceDelay` config option - milliseconds to wait before auto-advancing to next track
  - Removed all `as any` casts from event emissions (events now typed in core)

  **Chromecast:**
  - Detects media-ended on Cast device via `isMediaLoaded` state transition (true → false), emitting `playback:ended` so playlists auto-advance during casting
  - Listens for `media:load-request` to load new media on Cast device when Chromecast is active
  - Registered `IS_MEDIA_LOADED_CHANGED` event listener for reliable detection

  **HLS:**
  - Forces native HLS when AirPlay is active during `loadSource()`, preventing hls.js from interfering with wireless playback

  **AirPlay:**
  - Automatically switches back to hls.js when AirPlay disconnects, restoring quality control

  **Watermark (NEW):**
  - Anti-piracy watermark overlay plugin with text or image rendering
  - Configurable position, opacity, font size
  - Dynamic repositioning mode (moves to random position periodically)
  - Configurable show delay
  - Per-track watermark updates via playlist metadata (`watermarkUrl`, `watermarkText`)

  **Captions (NEW):**
  - WebVTT subtitle/caption plugin using browser-native `<track>` element rendering
  - External WebVTT source loading
  - HLS.js subtitle track extraction
  - Track selection via existing `track:text` event (works with CaptionsButton and SettingsMenu)
  - Auto-select with configurable default language
  - Automatic cleanup on source change

  **Embed:**
  - Added watermark and captions plugins to full and video embed builds

  **Breaking Change Note:**
  Existing consumers that manually wire `playlist:change` to `player.load()` will get double-loads when `autoLoad` is `true` (the new default). Set `autoLoad: false` to preserve the previous manual behavior, or remove the manual wiring.

## 0.5.3

### Patch Changes

- Bug fixes, stability improvements, and live DVR wiring

  **Bug Fixes:**
  - Fix MIME type detection for URLs with query params/fragments (e.g., `video.m3u8?token=abc`)
  - Fix spinner stuck on screen - `playing` event handler now clears `waiting` and `buffering` states
  - Fix `setPlaybackRate()` accepting invalid values - now clamped to 0.0625-16 range
  - Fix `setQuality()` accepting out-of-bounds indices - now validates against available quality levels
  - Fix analytics memory leak - cap `errors` array at 100 and `bitrateHistory` at 500 entries for long sessions
  - Fix HLS error test expecting `logger.warn` for fatal errors (should be `logger.error`)
  - Fix demo page crash when `getState` called before player initialization

  **Live DVR:**
  - Wire up `seekableRange`, `liveEdge`, and `liveLatency` state in HLS plugin - existing UI controls (LiveIndicator, ProgressBar DVR, TimeDisplay, SkipButton) now receive live stream data

  **Dependencies:**
