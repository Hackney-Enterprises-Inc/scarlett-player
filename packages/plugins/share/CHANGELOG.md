## 1.7.1

### Patch Changes

- [#74](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/74) [`170dba5`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/170dba59110517acdb214099414052c99a2d6ad8) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Reports its real version, and requires `@scarlett-player/core@^1.7.0`.

  The descriptor's `version` was the hand-written literal '1.0.0' while the
  package published at 1.7.0, so anything that read a version off the plugin
  reported a number that had not been true since the descriptor was written
  (measured 2026-09-02). It comes from the package's own package.json now:
  `src/version.ts` reads a `__PKG_VERSION__` define set by the new
  `tsup.config.ts`, with a '0.0.0-dev' fallback for test runs. The `build` and
  `dev` scripts call plain `tsup`, so the entry points, formats and `--dts` flag
  are written down once in the config instead of twice in package.json. The
  move does not change what tsup emits: the md5 of `dist/index.d.ts` and
  `dist/index.d.cts` is unchanged across it (compared 2026-09-02).

  The `@scarlett-player/core` peer range moves from `^1.3.0` to `^1.7.0` and
  `@scarlett-player/ui` from `^1.3.0` to `^1.7.0`. The old ranges were
  wrong across the workspace, not merely inconsistent: three of the packages
  declaring `^1.0.3` (audio-ui, media-session, ui) call `defineState`, which core
  gained in 1.4.0. Changesets is configured with
  `onlyUpdatePeerDependentsWhenOutOfRange`, so future minors of core will not
  cascade this into a major.

  The `@example` docblock shows `createPlayer()`. The `new ScarlettPlayer(...)`
  shape it used to show left the player with a provider and nothing else before
  core 1.7.1, so anyone copying the example got no controls and no working
  "Try Again".

### Minor Changes

- [#62](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/62) [`044114c`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/044114ca29c675c4dea643882b966a27bb1b6afa) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - New package: `@scarlett-player/share`.

  A share control for the player - the OS share sheet on mobile, copy link, social targets, embed codes, and playback timestamps. Zero configuration shares the current page URL with the position appended; the host adds `'share'` to its control layout to place the button.

  **Mobile is the primary path.** Where `navigator.share` exists and no custom target list is configured, tapping the button opens the native sheet directly rather than putting an in-player menu in front of it. When the in-player sheet is used it is a bottom sheet within thumb reach, with a grab handle and `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` honoured, promoting to a popover at 640px and up. Targets are 72px tall with press rather than hover states, the manual-copy fallback uses 16px text so iOS Safari does not zoom the viewport, and `prefers-reduced-motion` is respected. The sheet renders inside the player container so it survives fullscreen, traps focus, closes on Escape, and restores focus to the button.

  **What gets shared is the page, never the media `src`.** Playback URLs are frequently signed, so sharing one would leak a credential and produce a link that expires. There is no configuration or code path that falls back to `src`, and a test asserts it. The URL defaults to `window.location.href` and is overridable - which matters most inside `iframe.html`, where `window.location.href` is the player page and cross-origin rules block reading the parent. `@scarlett-player/embed` now accepts a `shareUrl` parameter for exactly that, and the `embed` target generates snippets with it already set.

  Timestamps are applied through the URL API, so an existing query string or fragment survives and re-sharing replaces the previous timestamp instead of appending a second. Live media never gets one, since an offset into a sliding DVR window is meaningless to the recipient. A dismissed native sheet rejects with `AbortError` and is treated as a choice rather than an error, and the clipboard falls back through `execCommand` to showing the link for manual copying.
