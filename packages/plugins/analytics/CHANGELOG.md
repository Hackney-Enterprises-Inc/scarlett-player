# @scarlett-player/analytics

## 1.9.0

### Minor Changes

- [#84](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/84) [`48ffe30`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/48ffe30b5246e478e175ff9790d62f4ff68665e8) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Accessibility, multi-player safety, casting stability, audio renditions and
  reactive Vue bindings.

  **UI controls and accessibility**
  - Keyboard shortcuts now stand down for modifier chords (Cmd/Ctrl/Alt), for a
    key another handler already consumed (`defaultPrevented`), and for the keys a
    focused widget acts on itself - Space and Enter on a button or menu item, the
    arrows and Home/End on a slider. One ArrowLeft on the progress bar seeks 5s
    again instead of 10s. Letter shortcuts (`f`, `m`, `k`) still work with a
    control focused.
  - Closing the settings menu returns focus to the gear button instead of dropping
    it to `<body>`, so a keyboard viewer is not stranded outside the player.
    Clicking elsewhere still leaves focus where the viewer put it.
  - Touching the control bar or the scrubber restarts the auto-hide timer even
    when a gestures plugin owns taps on the picture, and the bar no longer hides
    while a settings menu, quality menu or overflow tray is open.
  - The error overlay is cleared when a new source loads, and dismissing an error
    brings the big play button back instead of hiding it for the session.
  - `.sp-container` sets `isolation: isolate`, so the player's overlays stay
    inside the player rather than competing with the host page's layers.

  **Multi-player safety**
  - Plugin-contributed controls can be registered against one player
    (`registerControl(id, factory, { owner: api.container })`), and are dropped on
    that player's teardown. `chapters`, `playlist` and `share` now do this, so a
    second player on the page can no longer take over the first one's controls.
  - Shared stylesheets are reference-counted through the new
    `injectSharedStyles()` helper in core, so destroying one player no longer
    strips the styling from the players still mounted (`ui`, `gestures`,
    `chapters`, `share`, `playlist`).

  **Casting**
  - AirPlay re-attaches to the media element after a provider swap instead of
    holding the first one forever, cancels its Remote Playback availability watch
    on teardown, and opens the device picker inside the user's click gesture. The
    switch to native HLS now happens when a device actually connects, so
    cancelling the picker no longer traps the viewer on the native path.
  - The Cast SDK load times out after 10s instead of hanging player
    initialisation, and chains an existing `__onGCastApiAvailable` callback rather
    than clobbering another sender's.

  **Playback**
  - The native provider reports distinct error codes (`MEDIA_NETWORK_ERROR`,
    `MEDIA_DECODE_ERROR`, `SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`) instead of collapsing everything
    into `PLAYBACK_FAILED`, and treats a "source not supported" error after the
    stream has parsed as a network failure, which is how Safari's native HLS
    reports a mid-stream outage. It also carries a load-session guard, so a
    superseded `load()` settles its promise and cannot fire a stale watchdog.
  - HLS exposes alternate audio renditions: `audioTracks` and `currentAudioTrack`
    state, selection through the `track:audio` event, and an Audio panel in the
    settings menu when a manifest declares more than one.

  **Embed**
  - `initAll()` initialises every player on the page concurrently, and one bad
    embed no longer stops the rest.
  - `startTime` is applied once metadata has loaded, rather than being dropped on
    a cold load.
  - Class names are tokenised on whitespace runs (a double space no longer throws)
    and a video embed with neither height nor aspect ratio falls back to 16:9
    instead of rendering 0px tall.

  **Core reactivity**
  - `effect()` keeps a stack of executing effects, so nested effects and computeds
    restore the enclosing tracking context, and re-collects dependencies on every
    run, so a signal an effect stops reading stops waking it.
  - `EventBus.once()` removes each handler individually before invoking it, so a
    handler registered from inside another once-handler survives the emit.
  - `StateChangeEvent.previousValue` reports the value the key actually held.
  - New: `ScarlettPlayer.subscribeToState()`, the push side of `getState()`.

  **Vue**
  - The player instance is held in a `shallowRef` and `markRaw`'d, removing the
    reactive-proxy overhead and the broken private-field access.
  - `isBuffering` updates when playback buffers instead of being permanently
    false, and a `live` ref is exposed alongside it.
  - Declarations are emitted with `vue-tsc`, so `@scarlett-player/vue` no longer
    ships a `dist/index.d.ts` importing a `.vue` path consumers cannot resolve.
    `publint` runs as part of the package's build.

  **Build guards**
  - Every package now type-checks its tests (`tsconfig.typecheck.json` added to
    `ui`, `audio-ui`, `playlist`, `media-session`, `embed` and `vue`).
  - New `scripts/check-package-types.mjs` compiles a throwaway consumer against
    every package's published declarations, catching a `.d.ts` that exists but
    does not resolve. Wired into CI and the release workflow.

  ### Core
  - Asynchronous `destroy()`: Player destruction now awaits asynchronous plugin teardowns before tearing down the event bus and state manager, and returns a cached promise for concurrent teardown calls.
  - Concurrent and re-entrant plugin initialization: In-flight plugin initialization promises are cached and shared across concurrent callers, with cycle detection preserved.
  - Event contracts: Added `longOutage?: boolean` property to `error:reconnecting` event payload for extended outage notifications.
  - Source loading: Resets live state classification when starting each new source.

  ### HLS Plugin
  - Playback stall watchdog: Added bounded stall watchdog using level target duration that monitors playback progress and synthesizes recoverable errors if playback stalls.
  - Live stream auto-reconnect: Tracks explicit live classification to prevent unclassified or stale live states from bypassing playback checks.
  - Online reconnect guard: Restricts browser online event reconnects to active or in-flight reconnect cycles.
  - Extended outage notifications: Emits `longOutage: true` after prolonged reconnect attempts on live streams.
  - Seekable range fallback: Non-negative clamping for `liveSyncPosition` fallback.

  ### Analytics Plugin
  - Fetch transport: Migrated primary beacon transport to `fetch` with `keepalive: true` to support custom headers (`X-API-Key`).
  - Unload transport fallback: When `navigator.sendBeacon` returns false, falls back to keepalive `fetch`.
  - Query parameter preservation: Constructs unload beacon URL via URL searchParams to cleanly append `api_key`.
  - Unload deduplication: Deduplicates `beforeunload` and `pagehide` invocations via `session.viewEnd`.

  ### Chromecast & Native Providers
  - Chromecast ended detection: Reads `playerState` and `idleReason` from the active media session.
  - Native provider command guard: Suppresses native playback actions while `chromecastActive` is true.
  - Playback event lifecycle: Preserves single `playback:play` emission across core commands and direct element play calls without recursion.

  ### Watermark Plugin
  - Content state handling: Setting text clears previously active image URL, and setting an image clears previously active text.

  ### Vue Integration
  - Stable instance reference: Captures local reference during asynchronous setup and teardown in `ScarlettPlayer.vue`.

  ### UI & Embed
  - Container class management: Preserves host-owned `sp-container` classes during plugin teardown.
  - Seek safety: Non-finite seek position guards preventing unexpected seeks to beginning.
  - Embed release alignment: Deployment documentation aligned with `v${VERSION}` CDN release contracts.

### Patch Changes

- [#79](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/79) [`71863ee`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/71863ee8681a29d847da079218a6bfe410f722d1) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Ensure fetch fallback only attaches apiKey as X-API-Key header when beaconUrl uses HTTPS.

- [#79](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/79) [`71863ee`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/71863ee8681a29d847da079218a6bfe410f722d1) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Clarify analytics privacy responsibilities for consent, data minimization, and redaction, including viewer IDs in beacon payloads.

- [#79](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/79) [`71863ee`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/71863ee8681a29d847da079218a6bfe410f722d1) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Peer dependency ranges now name the current major line: `@scarlett-player/core`
  and `@scarlett-player/ui` move from `^1.7.0` to `^1.8.0` in the Vue wrapper and
  in every plugin that had not already been bumped, leaving the whole fixed
  version group asking for one range. Nothing was resolving wrongly before, since
  `^1.7.0` already admits 1.8.0, but the declared floor now matches the version
  these packages are actually built and tested against rather than trailing a
  release behind it.

## 1.8.0

## 1.7.1

### Patch Changes

- [#74](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/74) [`170dba5`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/170dba59110517acdb214099414052c99a2d6ad8) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Every beacon now carries the real player version, and the plugin requires
  `@scarlett-player/core@^1.7.0`.

  `PLUGIN_VERSION` was the hand-written literal '0.1.0' while the package
  published at 1.7.0 (measured 2026-09-02). It is not only the descriptor's
  `version`: it is the `playerVersion` field stamped on every beacon, so every row
  collected so far records a player version that never matched a release, and no
  analytics query can tell one player build from another. It comes from the
  package's own package.json now: `src/version.ts` reads a `__PKG_VERSION__`
  define set by the new `tsup.config.ts`, with a '0.0.0-dev' fallback for test
  runs. The `build` and `dev` scripts call plain `tsup`, so the entry point,
  formats and `--dts` flag are written down once in the config instead of twice in
  package.json. The move does not change what tsup emits: the md5 of
  `dist/index.d.ts` and `dist/index.d.cts` is unchanged across it (compared
  2026-09-02).

  The `@scarlett-player/core` peer range moves from `^1.0.3` to `^1.7.0`.
  The old ranges were wrong across the workspace, not merely inconsistent: three
  of the packages declaring `^1.0.3` (audio-ui, media-session, ui) call
  `defineState`, which core gained in 1.4.0. Changesets is configured with
  `onlyUpdatePeerDependentsWhenOutOfRange`, so future minors of core will not
  cascade this into a major.
