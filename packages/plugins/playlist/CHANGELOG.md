### Patch Changes

- [#38](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/38) [`8a36597`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/8a365974bb67fa7ea945a3f2594112ac27cd75f4) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Add `initialIndex` config option to playlist plugin. When tracks are provided via config and the player loads the first source through the constructor, `initialIndex` syncs the playlist's internal state so auto-advance works correctly (track 0 → track 1 instead of replaying track 0).

### Minor Changes

- [#35](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/35) [`96bbb45`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/96bbb45881c45f2a183d1a56337bab1e47648ba7) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Automatic playlist loading, Chromecast playlist support, AirPlay improvements, watermark and captions plugins

  **Core:**
  - Added `media:load-request` event for plugins to request media loading without direct `player.load()` access
  - Promoted playlist events (`playlist:change`, `playlist:add`, `playlist:remove`, `playlist:clear`, `playlist:shuffle`, `playlist:repeat`, `playlist:reorder`, `playlist:ended`) to core `PlayerEventMap`
  - Added minimal `PlaylistTrack` interface to core types
  - Core player listens for `media:load-request` and routes load to local player (skips when Chromecast is active)

  **Playlist:**
  - New `autoLoad` config option (default: `true`) — automatically emits `media:load-request` on track change, eliminating the need for manual `player.load()` wiring
  - New `advanceDelay` config option — milliseconds to wait before auto-advancing to next track
  - Removed all `as any` casts from event emissions (events now typed in core)

  **Chromecast:**
  - Detects media-ended on Cast device via `isMediaLoaded` state transition (true → false), emitting `playback:ended` so playlists auto-advance during casting
  - Listens for `media:load-request` to load new media on Cast device when Chromecast is active
  - Registered `IS_MEDIA_LOADED_CHANGED` event listener for reliable detection

  **HLS:**
  - Forces native HLS when AirPlay is active during `loadSource()`, preventing hls.js from interfering with wireless playback

  **AirPlay:**
  - Automatically switches back to hls.js when AirPlay disconnects, restoring quality control

  **Watermark (NEW):**
  - Anti-piracy watermark overlay plugin with text or image rendering
  - Configurable position, opacity, font size
  - Dynamic repositioning mode (moves to random position periodically)
  - Configurable show delay
  - Per-track watermark updates via playlist metadata (`watermarkUrl`, `watermarkText`)

  **Captions (NEW):**
  - WebVTT subtitle/caption plugin using browser-native `<track>` element rendering
  - External WebVTT source loading
  - HLS.js subtitle track extraction
  - Track selection via existing `track:text` event (works with CaptionsButton and SettingsMenu)
  - Auto-select with configurable default language
  - Automatic cleanup on source change

  **Embed:**
  - Added watermark and captions plugins to full and video embed builds

  **Breaking Change Note:**
  Existing consumers that manually wire `playlist:change` to `player.load()` will get double-loads when `autoLoad` is `true` (the new default). Set `autoLoad: false` to preserve the previous manual behavior, or remove the manual wiring.
