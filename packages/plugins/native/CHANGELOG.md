# @scarlett-player/native

## 1.9.0

### Minor Changes

- [#84](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/84) [`48ffe30`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/48ffe30b5246e478e175ff9790d62f4ff68665e8) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Accessibility, multi-player safety, casting stability, audio renditions and
  reactive Vue bindings.

  **UI controls and accessibility**
  - Keyboard shortcuts now stand down for modifier chords (Cmd/Ctrl/Alt), for a
    key another handler already consumed (`defaultPrevented`), and for the keys a
    focused widget acts on itself - Space and Enter on a button or menu item, the
    arrows and Home/End on a slider. One ArrowLeft on the progress bar seeks 5s
    again instead of 10s. Letter shortcuts (`f`, `m`, `k`) still work with a
    control focused.
  - Closing the settings menu returns focus to the gear button instead of dropping
    it to `<body>`, so a keyboard viewer is not stranded outside the player.
    Clicking elsewhere still leaves focus where the viewer put it.
  - Touching the control bar or the scrubber restarts the auto-hide timer even
    when a gestures plugin owns taps on the picture, and the bar no longer hides
    while a settings menu, quality menu or overflow tray is open.
  - The error overlay is cleared when a new source loads, and dismissing an error
    brings the big play button back instead of hiding it for the session.
  - `.sp-container` sets `isolation: isolate`, so the player's overlays stay
    inside the player rather than competing with the host page's layers.

  **Multi-player safety**
  - Plugin-contributed controls can be registered against one player
    (`registerControl(id, factory, { owner: api.container })`), and are dropped on
    that player's teardown. `chapters`, `playlist` and `share` now do this, so a
    second player on the page can no longer take over the first one's controls.
  - Shared stylesheets are reference-counted through the new
    `injectSharedStyles()` helper in core, so destroying one player no longer
    strips the styling from the players still mounted (`ui`, `gestures`,
    `chapters`, `share`, `playlist`).

  **Casting**
  - AirPlay re-attaches to the media element after a provider swap instead of
    holding the first one forever, cancels its Remote Playback availability watch
    on teardown, and opens the device picker inside the user's click gesture. The
    switch to native HLS now happens when a device actually connects, so
    cancelling the picker no longer traps the viewer on the native path.
  - The Cast SDK load times out after 10s instead of hanging player
    initialisation, and chains an existing `__onGCastApiAvailable` callback rather
    than clobbering another sender's.

  **Playback**
  - The native provider reports distinct error codes (`MEDIA_NETWORK_ERROR`,
    `MEDIA_DECODE_ERROR`, `SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`) instead of collapsing everything
    into `PLAYBACK_FAILED`, and treats a "source not supported" error after the
    stream has parsed as a network failure, which is how Safari's native HLS
    reports a mid-stream outage. It also carries a load-session guard, so a
    superseded `load()` settles its promise and cannot fire a stale watchdog.
  - HLS exposes alternate audio renditions: `audioTracks` and `currentAudioTrack`
    state, selection through the `track:audio` event, and an Audio panel in the
    settings menu when a manifest declares more than one.

  **Embed**
  - `initAll()` initialises every player on the page concurrently, and one bad
    embed no longer stops the rest.
  - `startTime` is applied once metadata has loaded, rather than being dropped on
    a cold load.
  - Class names are tokenised on whitespace runs (a double space no longer throws)
    and a video embed with neither height nor aspect ratio falls back to 16:9
    instead of rendering 0px tall.

  **Core reactivity**
  - `effect()` keeps a stack of executing effects, so nested effects and computeds
    restore the enclosing tracking context, and re-collects dependencies on every
    run, so a signal an effect stops reading stops waking it.
  - `EventBus.once()` removes each handler individually before invoking it, so a
    handler registered from inside another once-handler survives the emit.
  - `StateChangeEvent.previousValue` reports the value the key actually held.
  - New: `ScarlettPlayer.subscribeToState()`, the push side of `getState()`.

  **Vue**
  - The player instance is held in a `shallowRef` and `markRaw`'d, removing the
    reactive-proxy overhead and the broken private-field access.
  - `isBuffering` updates when playback buffers instead of being permanently
    false, and a `live` ref is exposed alongside it.
  - Declarations are emitted with `vue-tsc`, so `@scarlett-player/vue` no longer
    ships a `dist/index.d.ts` importing a `.vue` path consumers cannot resolve.
    `publint` runs as part of the package's build.

  **Build guards**
  - Every package now type-checks its tests (`tsconfig.typecheck.json` added to
    `ui`, `audio-ui`, `playlist`, `media-session`, `embed` and `vue`).
  - New `scripts/check-package-types.mjs` compiles a throwaway consumer against
    every package's published declarations, catching a `.d.ts` that exists but
    does not resolve. Wired into CI and the release workflow.

- [#83](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/83) [`9999776`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/9999776062e8e4191a0f542dc4033e8a4a17958c) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Release v1.9.0

  ### Core
  - Asynchronous `destroy()`: Player destruction now awaits asynchronous plugin teardowns before tearing down the event bus and state manager, and returns a cached promise for concurrent teardown calls.
  - Concurrent and re-entrant plugin initialization: In-flight plugin initialization promises are cached and shared across concurrent callers, with cycle detection preserved.
  - Event contracts: Added `longOutage?: boolean` property to `error:reconnecting` event payload for extended outage notifications.
  - Source loading: Resets live state classification when starting each new source.

  ### HLS Plugin
  - Playback stall watchdog: Added bounded stall watchdog using level target duration that monitors playback progress and synthesizes recoverable errors if playback stalls.
  - Live stream auto-reconnect: Tracks explicit live classification to prevent unclassified or stale live states from bypassing playback checks.
  - Online reconnect guard: Restricts browser online event reconnects to active or in-flight reconnect cycles.
  - Extended outage notifications: Emits `longOutage: true` after prolonged reconnect attempts on live streams.
  - Seekable range fallback: Non-negative clamping for `liveSyncPosition` fallback.

  ### Analytics Plugin
  - Fetch transport: Migrated primary beacon transport to `fetch` with `keepalive: true` to support custom headers (`X-API-Key`).
  - Unload transport fallback: When `navigator.sendBeacon` returns false, falls back to keepalive `fetch`.
  - Query parameter preservation: Constructs unload beacon URL via URL searchParams to cleanly append `api_key`.
  - Unload deduplication: Deduplicates `beforeunload` and `pagehide` invocations via `session.viewEnd`.

  ### Chromecast & Native Providers
  - Chromecast ended detection: Reads `playerState` and `idleReason` from the active media session.
  - Native provider command guard: Suppresses native playback actions while `chromecastActive` is true.
  - Playback event lifecycle: Preserves single `playback:play` emission across core commands and direct element play calls without recursion.

  ### Watermark Plugin
  - Content state handling: Setting text clears previously active image URL, and setting an image clears previously active text.

  ### Vue Integration
  - Stable instance reference: Captures local reference during asynchronous setup and teardown in `ScarlettPlayer.vue`.

  ### UI & Embed
  - Container class management: Preserves host-owned `sp-container` classes during plugin teardown.
  - Seek safety: Non-finite seek position guards preventing unexpected seeks to beginning.
  - Embed release alignment: Deployment documentation aligned with `v${VERSION}` CDN release contracts.

## 1.8.1

### Patch Changes

- [#79](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/79) [`71863ee`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/71863ee8681a29d847da079218a6bfe410f722d1) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Peer dependency ranges now name the current major line: `@scarlett-player/core`
  and `@scarlett-player/ui` move from `^1.7.0` to `^1.8.0` in the Vue wrapper and
  in every plugin that had not already been bumped, leaving the whole fixed
  version group asking for one range. Nothing was resolving wrongly before, since
  `^1.7.0` already admits 1.8.0, but the declared floor now matches the version
  these packages are actually built and tested against rather than trailing a
  release behind it.

## 1.8.0

## 1.7.1

### Patch Changes

- [#74](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/74) [`170dba5`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/170dba59110517acdb214099414052c99a2d6ad8) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Reports its real version, and requires `@scarlett-player/core@^1.7.0`.

  The descriptor's `version` was the hand-written literal '1.0.0' while the
  package published at 1.7.0, so anything that read a version off the plugin
  reported a number that had not been true since the descriptor was written
  (measured 2026-09-02). It comes from the package's own package.json now:
  `src/version.ts` reads a `__PKG_VERSION__` define set by the new
  `tsup.config.ts`, with a '0.0.0-dev' fallback for test runs. The `build` and
  `dev` scripts call plain `tsup`, so the entry points, formats and `--dts` flag
  are written down once in the config instead of twice in package.json. The
  move does not change what tsup emits: the md5 of `dist/index.d.ts` and
  `dist/index.d.cts` is unchanged across it (compared 2026-09-02).

  The `@scarlett-player/core` peer range moves from `^1.0.3` to `^1.7.0`.
  The old ranges were
  wrong across the workspace, not merely inconsistent: three of the packages
  declaring `^1.0.3` (audio-ui, media-session, ui) call `defineState`, which core
  gained in 1.4.0. Changesets is configured with
  `onlyUpdatePeerDependentsWhenOutOfRange`, so future minors of core will not
  cascade this into a major.

  The `@example` docblock shows `createPlayer()`. The `new ScarlettPlayer(...)`
  shape it used to show left the player with a provider and nothing else before
  core 1.7.1, so anyone copying the example got no controls and no working
  "Try Again".

- [#74](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/74) [`170dba5`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/170dba59110517acdb214099414052c99a2d6ad8) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Re-applies the poster whenever it changes.

  The provider set `video.poster` when it created the element and on each
  `loadSource()`, but nothing re-applied it in between, so `setPoster()`, a
  playlist track change and a Vue prop change were all invisible to the viewer.
  One `applyPoster()` now serves element creation, `loadSource()` and a
  `subscribeToState()` subscription released through `api.onDestroy()`.

  An empty poster clears the attribute rather than being skipped, so a track
  without artwork can no longer inherit the previous one's image. The audio rule
  is unchanged and now holds against state changes too: while the current source
  is audio the attribute stays cleared whatever the poster says.

  First tests to assert `video.poster` on this provider at all.

- [#74](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/74) [`170dba5`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/170dba59110517acdb214099414052c99a2d6ad8) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Clears the `ended` state key when playback leaves the end of the media.

  The `ended` handler set the key true and nothing in the provider ever set it
  back: the only writer that cleared it was core's `load()`. After one replay it
  stayed true for the rest of the session while `HTMLMediaElement.ended` was
  false, so the control bar's play button kept the Replay glyph over playing
  video (the reason `@scarlett-player/ui`'s big play button reads `video.ended`
  instead of the key).

  The `play`, `playing` and `seeking` handlers now mirror the element's own flag
  back onto the key, which covers the three ways the position can leave the end:
  `play()` rewinds an ended element before firing `play`, the first frame fires
  `playing`, and a paused viewer scrubbing back from the end fires neither. The
  element is asked rather than assumed, so a seek that lands on the end leaves
  the key set; writing it true stays the `ended` handler's job.

- [#74](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/74) [`170dba5`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/170dba59110517acdb214099414052c99a2d6ad8) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Writes `playbackState` during ordinary playback, the way the HLS provider does.

  This provider only ever wrote `'loading'` and `'ready'`: `playing`, `pause` and
  `ended` left the key at whatever the last load had set, so what a reader of
  `playbackState` saw depended on which provider happened to be playing. The
  three handlers now write `'playing'`, `'paused'` and `'ended'`, the values
  `@scarlett-player/hls` has always written from the same events.

  The handlers that clear the `ended` key (`play`, `playing` and `seeking`) also
  re-derive `playbackState` from the element, `'paused'` or `'playing'` from
  `video.paused`, so a paused scrub away from the end does not leave the key at
  `'ended'`. Both writes are gated on the key having been set, so an ordinary
  mid-video seek restates neither.

  The shipped readers are almost unmoved by this: the error overlay only asks
  whether the key is `'error'` or `'loading'`, and the big play button's
  `'idle'`/`'ready'` test is reached only while nothing has played yet and the
  position is 0, which the `'playing'` and `'ended'` writes and the two
  scrub writes cannot be. The one case it does move is a `pause` in that same
  window (a `play()` cancelled before the first frame), where the button now
  stands down instead of staying up, which is what the HLS provider has always
  done there.

### Patch Changes

- [#55](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/55) [`2828556`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/2828556b09bd2cc2e9c62d7f8e74ce325984c34c) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Picture-in-Picture readiness gate: the PiP button is disabled until media metadata is loaded (entering PiP earlier rejects with InvalidStateError), every PiP call is caught so a failure can never surface as an unhandled rejection, Safari's presentation-mode path gets the same gate, and the button swaps to the exit icon while in PiP. The native provider now tracks PiP events so the pip state stays accurate on that path. Keyboard play and fullscreen shortcuts no longer leak promise rejections, and the error overlay has specific copy for append, buffer-full, and invalid-playlist failures.

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [#50](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/50) [`db2d670`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/db2d670cdaf2feb287702e4cfe536e5a07d24b54) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Stop the native provider's audio filename fallback from overwriting playlist track titles (#45).

  The fallback claimed to only set the title "if one doesn't already exist" but never checked, so every audio load replaced the playlist's track title with the derived filename. The native provider now remembers which title it derived itself: it only writes a fallback when the title is empty or still its own previous fallback, and always respects an externally set title.

  The playlist plugin now always writes the title on track change (empty when the track has none), so a previous track's title can no longer leak into a following untitled track; providers fill in the filename fallback for those.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#46](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/46) [`29c560d`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/29c560d3a199acb598f99ff1226b7c602775839f) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Make failure handling viewer-friendly: no silent hangs, self-healing reconnects, accurate error messages, and a Try Again that actually recovers.

  **No more permanent spinners.** Manifest-phase network errors (404/403, expired token, origin down) previously died silently after one recovery attempt because `startLoad()` cannot retry a manifest that never parsed, leaving `player.init()` pending forever. Manifest errors now retry with `loadSource()`, and a load watchdog (`loadTimeoutMs`, default 30s) guarantees every load attempt terminates with a real error.

  **Self-healing playback.** After a fatal network/media error mid-playback, the HLS provider now auto-reconnects with capped exponential backoff (configurable via `autoReconnect`, `reconnectBaseDelayMs`, `reconnectMaxDelayMs`, `reconnectWindowMs`), reconnects immediately when the browser comes back online, restores the viewer's VOD position from the moment of failure, and rejoins live streams at the live edge. The overlay shows "Connection lost. Reconnecting..." while working and hides itself on recovery. Retry budgets also reset once media flows again, so transient blips spread across a long live event no longer permanently consume them.

  **Accurate error messages.** Fatal HLS errors now carry structured codes (`MEDIA_NETWORK_ERROR`, `MEDIA_DECODE_ERROR`, `PLAYBACK_FAILED`) and the overlay maps codes before falling back to prose matching, so a network outage shows the connection message instead of "Something went wrong." The `error` state key is now populated from every error event (and cleared on successful load); it was previously declared but never written. New events: `error:reconnecting` and `error:recovered`.

  **Try Again fixed.** The overlay's retry now emits `error:retry`, which the core handles by reloading through the provider path and restoring position (live streams rejoin the live edge). It previously wrote the raw manifest URL onto the MSE-backed video element and reset playback to 0.

  Native HLS (Safari) fatal video errors are now surfaced as structured player errors instead of failing silently, and the native provider gained the same load watchdog.

### Patch Changes
