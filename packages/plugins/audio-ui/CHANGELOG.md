# @scarlett-player/audio-ui

## 1.7.1

### Patch Changes

- [#74](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/74) [`170dba5`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/170dba59110517acdb214099414052c99a2d6ad8) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Reports its real version, and requires `@scarlett-player/core@^1.7.0`.

  The descriptor's `version` was the hand-written literal '1.0.0' while the
  package published at 1.7.0, so anything that read a version off the plugin
  reported a number that had not been true since the descriptor was written
  (measured 2026-09-02). It comes from the package's own package.json now:
  `src/version.ts` reads a `__PKG_VERSION__` define set by the new
  `tsup.config.ts`, with a '0.0.0-dev' fallback for test runs. The `build` and
  `dev` scripts call plain `tsup`, so the entry points, formats and `--dts` flag
  are written down once in the config instead of twice in package.json. The
  move does not change what tsup emits: the md5 of `dist/index.d.ts` and
  `dist/index.d.cts` is unchanged across it (compared 2026-09-02).

  The `@scarlett-player/core` peer range moves from `^1.0.3` to `^1.7.0`.
  The old ranges were
  wrong across the workspace, not merely inconsistent: three of the packages
  declaring `^1.0.3` (audio-ui, media-session, ui) call `defineState`, which core
  gained in 1.4.0. Changesets is configured with
  `onlyUpdatePeerDependentsWhenOutOfRange`, so future minors of core will not
  cascade this into a major.

### Patch Changes

- [#30](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/30) [`42b224b`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/42b224b65270277e28097af5d31f69a3c24ab471) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Stability, accessibility, and test coverage improvements

  **Bug Fixes:**
  - Fix memory leak in effect system - unsubscribe now properly removes effects from all signal subscriber sets
  - Fix analytics avgBitrate calculation - was dividing by total watch time (including paused), now uses actual playback time span
  - Fix race condition in load() - concurrent load calls no longer cause undefined behavior; stale loads are discarded
  - Add stall detection to native provider - handles `stalled`, `suspend`, and `abort` media events

  **Accessibility (WCAG):**
  - Add keyboard navigation to SettingsMenu (Arrow Up/Down, Enter/Space, Escape, focus trap)
  - Add 44x44px minimum touch targets to all button controls (WCAG 2.5.5)
  - Add descriptive ARIA labels to LiveIndicator (not just color-dependent)
  - Add aria-valuetext to VolumeControl and default ARIA values to ProgressBar
  - Add comprehensive ARIA labels to all Audio UI interactive elements

  **Test Coverage:**
  - Add 105 new tests for UI controls (ProgressBar, VolumeControl, SettingsMenu, TimeDisplay, LiveIndicator, ErrorOverlay)
  - Total test count: 1,214 (up from 1,109)
