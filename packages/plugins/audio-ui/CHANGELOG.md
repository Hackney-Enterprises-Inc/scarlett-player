# @scarlett-player/audio-ui

## 1.11.0

### Minor Changes

- [#88](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/88) [`e2ebd22`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/e2ebd22b3fde1a38e18e81ee8a1aef0afa7e892c) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Clips: new `@scarlett-player/clips` plugin - viewer-created clips, player side.
  - `createClipsPlugin(config)` adds a `'clip'` control (when `@scarlett-player/ui` is
    present) that opens a two-handle in/out selector anchored above the control bar:
    Pointer Events, touch and keyboard (arrows, Shift, Home/End), ARIA sliders with
    `formatTime` labels, an optional title field with a live counter, and clamp
    feedback that never pushes the other handle. A drag is owned by the pointer
    that started it: a second finger landing on the track is ignored until the
    first lifts.
  - `minDuration` / `maxDuration` / `defaultDuration` / `step` are all host
    configuration (fallbacks 5 / 60 / 30 / 1s), enforced in a pure range model and
    adjustable at runtime via `configure()`; `open()` pre-rolls a selection behind
    the playhead.
  - The selection loops in a preview while the selector is open; dragging a handle
    pauses and scrubs (100ms throttle) and restores play state on release.
  - v1 is VOD-only: the control hides on live and audio, and `open()` errors
    ('live-unsupported') rather than opening. Live/DVR reconciliation and
    wall-clock mapping are designed and deferred to Phase 2.
  - Two submission paths, host picks one: `onCreate(range)` for hosts with their
    own HTTP client, or a built-in `endpoint` POST transport (per-request header
    resolution, `same-origin` credentials by default, and an `AbortController`
    timeout that covers the response body as well as the headers - a stalled body
    fails as a `status: 0` timeout instead of hanging).
    The wire contract is the `ClipRange` object verbatim, camelCase, with a
    `clientRequestId` minted per open session as the idempotency key and no `src`.
    The player never polls; `clip:created` hands the host the server's `result`.
  - Fully headless with `ui: 'none'`: `open` / `setRange` / `setTitle` / `getRange` /
    `commit` / `close` / `configure`, the `clip:opened|changed|created|cancelled|error`
    events, and the `clipSelection` / `clipOpen` / `clipTitle` state keys all work
    with no UI package installed.
  - Peer ranges state what the package actually needs, as audited at 1.10.0:
    `@scarlett-player/clips` requires core `^1.10.0` (the release that added the
    `formatTime` export it imports); its optional ui peer is `^1.9.0`, which added
    the owner-scoped `registerControl`/`unregisterControl` options it registers with.
  - Core: the `defineState` and `StateStore` declaration-merging docblock examples
    now use `clipSelection`, matching the shipped plugin (comment-only).

## 1.10.0

### Minor Changes

- [#86](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/86) [`9b04fc4`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/9b04fc4408821eff0ce3d11cfba6c70784c2a9e8) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Review pass: state redefinition warnings, share-URL credential coverage, live
  seek clamping and playlist persistence.
  - `StateManager.define()` detects two collisions it used to miss: a key first
    defined with an explicit `undefined` default, and a plugin claiming a core
    key such as `volume`. Core defaults now come from `DEFAULT_STATE`, since core
    keys never reach the plugin default map. Identical re-runs stay silent.
  - That warning no longer builds its message with `JSON.stringify`, which threw
    on a circular default or a BigInt and turned a diagnostic into a broken
    `define()`.
  - `formatLiveTime()` reports `LIVE` for a non-finite distance instead of
    `-0:00`, which read as a precise offset derived from an unknown seekable end.
  - The default share URL also drops `id_token`, `refresh_token`, the AWS SigV4
    `x-amz-*` set and CloudFront's `key-pair-id`, so a page served from a
    presigned URL does not share its signature.
  - Media Session `seekbackward` and `seekforward` clamp at both ends of the DVR
    window. A `currentTime` recorded before the window slid sat outside the
    range, and a one-sided clamp left the target outside it too.
  - Playlist treats `tracks: []` as a supplied empty playlist rather than "no
    preference", so storage can no longer refill a list the host emptied;
    rejects a fractional persisted `currentIndex`, which passed the old `>= 0`
    test and then indexed nothing; and keeps a restored shuffle order that still
    covers every track instead of reshuffling a persisted session on every load.

  Peer dependency ranges now state the version each package actually needs,
  audited against core's and `ui`'s export surface at each release. Every plugin
  declared `^1.8.0` while importing APIs added later, so a consumer could resolve
  a core or `ui` old enough to be missing them:
  - `ui` and `audio-ui` require core `^1.10.0` - the release adding the
    `SHARED_ICON_PATHS` and `formatTime` exports they import.
  - `chapters`, `gestures`, `native`, `playlist` and `share` require core
    `^1.9.0`, which added `injectSharedStyles`, `ReleaseStyles` and
    `sanitizeUrl`.
  - `chapters`, `playlist` and `share` require `ui` `^1.9.0` for their optional
    peer. They register controls with `registerControl(id, factory, { owner })`
    and release them with `unregisterControl(id, { owner })`; the options
    argument arrived in 1.9.0, and against 1.8.0 the registration is silently
    global - the multi-player bug the `owner` scope exists to prevent.
  - `native` and `vue` declare `jsdom`, which their Vitest configs select as the
    test environment. It resolved only because pnpm satisfied Vitest's optional
    peer from another workspace package that did declare it.

- [#86](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/86) [`9b04fc4`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/9b04fc4408821eff0ce3d11cfba6c70784c2a9e8) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - UI: the progress tooltip returns after a mouse leave, a leaked keydown listener
  is removed, `--sp-*` is no longer declared on `:root`, and a window-resize
  fallback covers viewports without `ResizeObserver`. Audio UI: keyboard support
  on the progress and volume sliders, and no more per-tick `innerHTML` rewrites.

  **UI**
  - `ProgressBar` set `tooltip.style.opacity = '0'` on mouse leave and touch end.
    An inline style outranks the stylesheet's hover rule, so the tooltip never
    came back on a later hover. The inline value is now cleared instead.
  - `ProgressBar.destroy()` removes its `keydown` listener, which was the only
    one it left attached.
  - The stylesheet no longer declares `--sp-accent`, `--sp-color`, `--sp-bg`,
    `--sp-control-height` and `--sp-icon-size` on `:root`, which wrote five names
    into the host document. Defaults live at the use sites as `var()` fallbacks,
    so a host theming through its own `:root` keeps working and `setTheme()`
    still wins on the container.
  - Where `ResizeObserver` is unavailable the bar refits on a debounced window
    resize. It was previously fitted at init and on control changes and never
    again.

  **Audio UI**
  - The progress bar and volume slider respond to arrow keys, Home and End. Both
    already carried `role="slider"` and `tabindex="0"`, so a keyboard viewer
    could focus them and had nothing to press.
  - Button icons are only rewritten when they change. `updateUI()` runs on every
    `currentTime` tick and each `innerHTML` write reparsed the SVG.

  **Shared code**

  `formatTime`/`formatLiveTime` and the SVG paths both UI packages draw now live
  in `@scarlett-player/core`, which is already a peer dependency of both. `ui`
  re-exports the formatters, so its public surface is unchanged.
  `@scarlett-player/hls`'s `sanitizeUrl` re-exports core's implementation rather
  than duplicating it; it remains exported from both HLS entries.

### Patch Changes

- [#86](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/86) [`9b04fc4`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/9b04fc4408821eff0ce3d11cfba6c70784c2a9e8) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Clamp progress-bar keyboard seeks (ArrowLeft, ArrowRight, Home, End) into the active live DVR window, so a stale `currentTime` reported outside `seekableRange` can no longer produce a seek outside it.

- [#86](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/86) [`9b04fc4`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/9b04fc4408821eff0ce3d11cfba6c70784c2a9e8) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Bounds keyboard seeks on the audio progress bar to the live DVR window: when `live` is true and a `seekableRange` is reported, ArrowLeft/ArrowRight/Home/End clamp to the window instead of `[0, duration]` (which stays the fallback when no window is available). Home and ArrowLeft no longer target a time before the live window start, and End rides the window edge rather than the infinite duration a live stream reports.

## 1.9.0

### Minor Changes

- [#84](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/84) [`48ffe30`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/48ffe30b5246e478e175ff9790d62f4ff68665e8) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Accessibility, multi-player safety, casting stability, audio renditions and
  reactive Vue bindings.

  **UI controls and accessibility**
  - Keyboard shortcuts now stand down for modifier chords (Cmd/Ctrl/Alt), for a
    key another handler already consumed (`defaultPrevented`), and for the keys a
    focused widget acts on itself - Space and Enter on a button or menu item, the
    arrows and Home/End on a slider. One ArrowLeft on the progress bar seeks 5s
    again instead of 10s. Letter shortcuts (`f`, `m`, `k`) still work with a
    control focused.
  - Closing the settings menu returns focus to the gear button instead of dropping
    it to `<body>`, so a keyboard viewer is not stranded outside the player.
    Clicking elsewhere still leaves focus where the viewer put it.
  - Touching the control bar or the scrubber restarts the auto-hide timer even
    when a gestures plugin owns taps on the picture, and the bar no longer hides
    while a settings menu, quality menu or overflow tray is open.
  - The error overlay is cleared when a new source loads, and dismissing an error
    brings the big play button back instead of hiding it for the session.
  - `.sp-container` sets `isolation: isolate`, so the player's overlays stay
    inside the player rather than competing with the host page's layers.

  **Multi-player safety**
  - Plugin-contributed controls can be registered against one player
    (`registerControl(id, factory, { owner: api.container })`), and are dropped on
    that player's teardown. `chapters`, `playlist` and `share` now do this, so a
    second player on the page can no longer take over the first one's controls.
  - Shared stylesheets are reference-counted through the new
    `injectSharedStyles()` helper in core, so destroying one player no longer
    strips the styling from the players still mounted (`ui`, `gestures`,
    `chapters`, `share`, `playlist`).

  **Casting**
  - AirPlay re-attaches to the media element after a provider swap instead of
    holding the first one forever, cancels its Remote Playback availability watch
    on teardown, and opens the device picker inside the user's click gesture. The
    switch to native HLS now happens when a device actually connects, so
    cancelling the picker no longer traps the viewer on the native path.
  - The Cast SDK load times out after 10s instead of hanging player
    initialisation, and chains an existing `__onGCastApiAvailable` callback rather
    than clobbering another sender's.

  **Playback**
  - The native provider reports distinct error codes (`MEDIA_NETWORK_ERROR`,
    `MEDIA_DECODE_ERROR`, `SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`) instead of collapsing everything
    into `PLAYBACK_FAILED`, and treats a "source not supported" error after the
    stream has parsed as a network failure, which is how Safari's native HLS
    reports a mid-stream outage. It also carries a load-session guard, so a
    superseded `load()` settles its promise and cannot fire a stale watchdog.
  - HLS exposes alternate audio renditions: `audioTracks` and `currentAudioTrack`
    state, selection through the `track:audio` event, and an Audio panel in the
    settings menu when a manifest declares more than one.

  **Embed**
  - `initAll()` initialises every player on the page concurrently, and one bad
    embed no longer stops the rest.
  - `startTime` is applied once metadata has loaded, rather than being dropped on
    a cold load.
  - Class names are tokenised on whitespace runs (a double space no longer throws)
    and a video embed with neither height nor aspect ratio falls back to 16:9
    instead of rendering 0px tall.

  **Core reactivity**
  - `effect()` keeps a stack of executing effects, so nested effects and computeds
    restore the enclosing tracking context, and re-collects dependencies on every
    run, so a signal an effect stops reading stops waking it.
  - `EventBus.once()` removes each handler individually before invoking it, so a
    handler registered from inside another once-handler survives the emit.
  - `StateChangeEvent.previousValue` reports the value the key actually held.
  - New: `ScarlettPlayer.subscribeToState()`, the push side of `getState()`.

  **Vue**
  - The player instance is held in a `shallowRef` and `markRaw`'d, removing the
    reactive-proxy overhead and the broken private-field access.
  - `isBuffering` updates when playback buffers instead of being permanently
    false, and a `live` ref is exposed alongside it.
  - Declarations are emitted with `vue-tsc`, so `@scarlett-player/vue` no longer
    ships a `dist/index.d.ts` importing a `.vue` path consumers cannot resolve.
    `publint` runs as part of the package's build.

  **Build guards**
  - Every package now type-checks its tests (`tsconfig.typecheck.json` added to
    `ui`, `audio-ui`, `playlist`, `media-session`, `embed` and `vue`).
  - New `scripts/check-package-types.mjs` compiles a throwaway consumer against
    every package's published declarations, catching a `.d.ts` that exists but
    does not resolve. Wired into CI and the release workflow.

- [#83](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/83) [`9999776`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/9999776062e8e4191a0f542dc4033e8a4a17958c) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Release v1.9.0

  ### Core
  - Asynchronous `destroy()`: Player destruction now awaits asynchronous plugin teardowns before tearing down the event bus and state manager, and returns a cached promise for concurrent teardown calls.
  - Concurrent and re-entrant plugin initialization: In-flight plugin initialization promises are cached and shared across concurrent callers, with cycle detection preserved.
  - Event contracts: Added `longOutage?: boolean` property to `error:reconnecting` event payload for extended outage notifications.
  - Source loading: Resets live state classification when starting each new source.

  ### HLS Plugin
  - Playback stall watchdog: Added bounded stall watchdog using level target duration that monitors playback progress and synthesizes recoverable errors if playback stalls.
  - Live stream auto-reconnect: Tracks explicit live classification to prevent unclassified or stale live states from bypassing playback checks.
  - Online reconnect guard: Restricts browser online event reconnects to active or in-flight reconnect cycles.
  - Extended outage notifications: Emits `longOutage: true` after prolonged reconnect attempts on live streams.
  - Seekable range fallback: Non-negative clamping for `liveSyncPosition` fallback.

  ### Analytics Plugin
  - Fetch transport: Migrated primary beacon transport to `fetch` with `keepalive: true` to support custom headers (`X-API-Key`).
  - Unload transport fallback: When `navigator.sendBeacon` returns false, falls back to keepalive `fetch`.
  - Query parameter preservation: Constructs unload beacon URL via URL searchParams to cleanly append `api_key`.
  - Unload deduplication: Deduplicates `beforeunload` and `pagehide` invocations via `session.viewEnd`.

  ### Chromecast & Native Providers
  - Chromecast ended detection: Reads `playerState` and `idleReason` from the active media session.
  - Native provider command guard: Suppresses native playback actions while `chromecastActive` is true.
  - Playback event lifecycle: Preserves single `playback:play` emission across core commands and direct element play calls without recursion.

  ### Watermark Plugin
  - Content state handling: Setting text clears previously active image URL, and setting an image clears previously active text.

  ### Vue Integration
  - Stable instance reference: Captures local reference during asynchronous setup and teardown in `ScarlettPlayer.vue`.

  ### UI & Embed
  - Container class management: Preserves host-owned `sp-container` classes during plugin teardown.
  - Seek safety: Non-finite seek position guards preventing unexpected seeks to beginning.
  - Embed release alignment: Deployment documentation aligned with `v${VERSION}` CDN release contracts.

## 1.8.1

### Patch Changes

- [#79](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/79) [`71863ee`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/71863ee8681a29d847da079218a6bfe410f722d1) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Peer dependency ranges now name the current major line: `@scarlett-player/core`
  and `@scarlett-player/ui` move from `^1.7.0` to `^1.8.0` in the Vue wrapper and
  in every plugin that had not already been bumped, leaving the whole fixed
  version group asking for one range. Nothing was resolving wrongly before, since
  `^1.7.0` already admits 1.8.0, but the declared floor now matches the version
  these packages are actually built and tested against rather than trailing a
  release behind it.

- [#79](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/79) [`71863ee`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/71863ee8681a29d847da079218a6bfe410f722d1) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Use core payload types for Vue error, loaded, loadedmetadata, and qualitylevels
  events, and normalize non-Error initialization failures to Error instances.
  Correct the audio UI quick start to register a native playback provider and the
  Chromecast quick start to end casting through the plugin's endSession method.

## 1.8.0

## 1.7.1

### Patch Changes

- [#74](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/pull/74) [`170dba5`](https://github.com/Hackney-Enterprises-Inc/scarlett-player/commit/170dba59110517acdb214099414052c99a2d6ad8) Thanks [@alexhackney](https://github.com/alexhackney)! - Reports its real version, and requires `@scarlett-player/core@^1.7.0`.

  The descriptor's `version` was the hand-written literal '1.0.0' while the
  package published at 1.7.0, so anything that read a version off the plugin
  reported a number that had not been true since the descriptor was written
  (measured 2026-09-02). It comes from the package's own package.json now:
  `src/version.ts` reads a `__PKG_VERSION__` define set by the new
  `tsup.config.ts`, with a '0.0.0-dev' fallback for test runs. The `build` and
  `dev` scripts call plain `tsup`, so the entry points, formats and `--dts` flag
  are written down once in the config instead of twice in package.json. The
  move does not change what tsup emits: the md5 of `dist/index.d.ts` and
  `dist/index.d.cts` is unchanged across it (compared 2026-09-02).

  The `@scarlett-player/core` peer range moves from `^1.0.3` to `^1.7.0`.
  The old ranges were
  wrong across the workspace, not merely inconsistent: three of the packages
  declaring `^1.0.3` (audio-ui, media-session, ui) call `defineState`, which core
  gained in 1.4.0. Changesets is configured with
  `onlyUpdatePeerDependentsWhenOutOfRange`, so future minors of core will not
  cascade this into a major.
